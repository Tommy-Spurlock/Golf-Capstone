## Motivation:
I find the game of golf absolutely fascinating. Itâ€™s one of the most difficult, frustrating and mentally taxing games I have ever played, yet I find myself being more drawn to it each year. Watching the professionals take something so difficult and make it look so easy is astonishing to watch and  inspires me to work on my own game. Pros turn misses into pars and great shots into even better scores. Studying the pros game and learning where their strengths lie could be helpful to understand where the disparity is between pros and amateurs and help deepen understanding of what areas amateurs can work on to improve scores in the most  efficient manner.


## Questions:
1) Which performance metrics (e.g., driving distance, driving accuracy, putting accuracy, greens in regulation) are most strongly correlated with success in professional golfers? 

2) How do these key performance metrics vary across different skill levels of professional golfers?

3) How does the average number of greens in regulation (GIR) and driving accuracy/distance compare between players on The PGA Tour? 

4) Can we identify common performance weaknesses in professions that, if addressed by amateurs , could lead to significant improvements in their overall game?


## Acquiring and Normalizing the Data
The dataset I utilized was aquired from two sources. I had initally planned to use the Golf Data API. Data was collected from the api and formatted using Python. The second and most profilic source of data came from PGA Tour website. Their stats are seperated by category and able to be saved as csv's. 


## Problems and Hurdles
The challenge with the data from the pga tour was that there numerous csv's to combine to see the full picture of the data. Merging the data was a time consuming process and took a fair amount of cleaning before the data was ready for use.

## Technologies Used
1) Python / Pandas - for exploration, normalizing and aggregation of the dataset
2) Power Bi - for creating visuals 
3) PowerPoint - for introduction of Project
4) Git - for version control
